## 📖 About this Repository
This is the complete record of my Vision–Language–Action (VLA) learning journey, starting February 2026.
**Background:** Strong foundation in Python and deep learning; goal is to master VLA techniques and publish research.
**Learning Path:** Systematic learning plan based on the StarVLA project
**Update Frequency:** At least 3 commits per week

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- [ ] **Month 1:** Master modern architectures such as Transformer and ViT
- [ ] **Month 2:** Understand VLA implementation details
- [ ] **Months 3–4:** Complete MVP research project

## 📚 Progress

### ✅ Completed
- [√] Environment setup and StarVLA deployment
- [√] Learning roadmap finalized

### 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Week 1: Transformer architecture study
    - [ ] Read "Attention is All You Need"
    - [ ] Implement multi-head attention
    - [ ] Implement self-attention from scratch
    - [ ] LayerNorm and residual connections
    - [ ] Build a mini-Transformer
    - [ ] Understand positional encoding

### 📅 Planned
